Version 1 to version 1.1:

General bugfixes / changes:

Fixed: Filter count bug whereby the 'Showing ## of ##' text on the Roll report screen wasn't giving the correct information.
Fixed: When deleting a roll, assigned General history records were not getting deleted, so when a new roll is created with the same ID, they'd re-appear.
Fixed: Changed 'Demonstration Copy' to read company name if licence has been applied.
Database Write Check added to ensure user has write access (otherwise end-user will see failed SQL statements)
Now freeing image memory allocation before reallocating, caused memory usage increase unnecessarily.
Now storing 'Depth' values to database.
Added option to show Depth values on Roll Info screen (In settings).
Adjusted Roll info listicon gadgets in order to fit in the depth value.
Adjusted the roll Image and pin placement on the Roll Info screen to fit in the depth value.
Storing AniCAM Config string to database (Lighting settings, Lens, Zoom etc,.) ; For future comparative work (Prompting user if different settings have been used)
Changed keyboard shortcut to delete rolls etc from the 'Delete' key to a 'Shift+Delete' combination, otherwise the delete key wasn't functioning normally.
Re-ordered draw priorities so screen refreshes are completed before switching views.
Update 'Auto-Import' icon to reflect any change made in the 'Auto-Import' setting window
