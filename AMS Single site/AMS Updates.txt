 - Removed 'Warning Triggers' section from Settings as no longer required.



V1.65 -> V1.67 16.04.2021

 - Added percentage lines on Graph
 - Self-drawing Graph; RM Chart drawing was failing to display some foreign characters.

v1.64 12.02.2021
 - Updated with new Troika logos.

 - Small adjustment to report layout PDF export to allow for new wider logo.

 - Can automatically add Usage to roll by entering 'PD:' (or 'DD:') (Print/Drucke Distance) prefix in Anilox QC comments field.
	- Can shorthand units by using 'k' or 'm' - I.e. 1250000 can be entered as 1.25m.

 - Automatic cleaning report record creation by using 'CR:', followed by some explanatory text (i.e: 'CR: Bicarb wash 30 minutes' in the comments field in Anilox QC.

 - Added new generic General History selections instead of the need to key it each time - To support new report system.
	This sucks in existing entries
	New table to maintain in Options\Settings.

 - Added new report system.
	Can now create custom layouts, selecting fields you need and in the order you need them.
	Additional fields addable from General History table or Comments line (1, 2 or 3).
	Additional filter added to filter out non-populated fields from Comments or General History (GH) Table - added as unable to filter this in SQL.
		 i.e. If GH:Damage is selected, then enabling the GH Filter will hide any roll that doesn't have a Damage record.

 - Added a rudimentary Usage system.... not much room to implement properly unless roll layout is changed dramatically.
	Right-clicking on a roll in Roll Info view will allow for addition of a usage figure, this is non-specific, so the units could be anything....
	A Graph view of Volume by usage is also available, but will be identical to standard volume report (other than legends) as x-axis isn't scaled.
	Can add Usage on an import if an imported Comment line has a 'Usage:' header.

 - Launching AMS when an instance is already running no longer shows an error message but will display the currently running AMS.
